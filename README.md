The University Finder app is a simple and intuitive tool that helps U.S. students find the perfect college or university based on their GPA and SAT scores. By utilizing a third-party API, the app is able to suggest suitable schools that align with the student's qualifications and preferences. If the student does not qualify for their preferred school, the app suggests alternative options within the student's state of residence. With its user-friendly interface and accurate suggestions, the University Finder app is an essential tool for any student looking to further their education.
